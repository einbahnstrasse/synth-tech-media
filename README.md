#### What?  
A folder of test signals to use while prototyping your own patches and our pedagogical patches in class. 

#### How? 
Simply click on the `Code` button and choose `Download zip`. 
You may add your own test sounds to this folder at any time! 

#### CAUTION!  
**Do not** copy this into your own class repository! 
Instead, keep this outside of your folder of patches, but nearby 
(like, within the same directory as your repository of patches).
