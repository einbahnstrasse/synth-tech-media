#### What?    
A folder of test signals for use while prototyping your own   
Max patches as well as our pedagogical patches in class. 

#### How?   
Simply click on the `Code` button and choose `Download ZIP`.   
You may **add your own test sounds** to your own copy of this folder at any time!   

#### CAUTION!    
**Do not** copy this into your class repository!   
Instead, keep this outside of your folder of patches, but nearby   
(like, within the same directory as your repository of patches).
